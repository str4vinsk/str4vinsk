I'm a developer and a hacking 🧑‍💻 student, i love the art of hacking and the entire world surrounding it.

I'm currently learning about IoT and Web hacking, but for this, of course, i need to learn how to construct to after deconstruct!
So, my path is long, and wonderful at the same time, and this is my journal at this journey.
